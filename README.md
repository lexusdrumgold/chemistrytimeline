## ACS Chemical Landmarks Timeline

This project is a redesign of the older Chemical Landmark timeline, and is intended to improve the user experience of the older site, which can be found [here](https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/landmarks-timeline.html).

The [updated site](https://acs-chemistrytimeline.firebaseapp.com/) was using ReactJS.

## Install

Afterwards, run `gulp` to compile Sass. With gulp running, open another terminal tab and run `npm start`. This will launch the project on your local machine.
